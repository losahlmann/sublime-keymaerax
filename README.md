# sublime-keymaerax
A KeYmaeraX syntax definition for the Sublime Text 3 editor. It needs the latest version of Sublime Text 3 ( > build 3084).

This package is still very new, so contributions and bug reports are very welcome.

## Installation
The package is not yet available via the Sublime Text package control.

To install, just put the `KeYmaeraX.sublime-syntax` file into your `Packages/User` directory, which can be found via `Preferences | Browse Packages`. (It is usually `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`).

Then restart Sublime Text.
